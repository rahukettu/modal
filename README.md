# Android Studio Modal Example

This repository contains a sample Android Studio project demonstrating the implementation and usage of modals in an Android application. This example provides a practical guide on how to create, configure, and use modals in your Android app.

## Project Overview

This project includes a sample Android application that features a modal dialog. The modal demonstrates how to create and use a dialog in Android, providing a user interface for interactions that require user input or confirmation.

## Features

- Basic Android application setup
- Implementation of a modal dialog
- Example code for configuring and displaying the modal
- Customization options for the modal's appearance and behavior

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahukettu/your-repository.git

2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**

```bash
        Launch Android Studio.
        Select "Open an Existing Project."
        Navigate to the cloned repository and open it.

3. **Sync Gradle:**

```bash
        Android Studio will prompt you to sync Gradle files. Click "Sync Now" to resolve all dependencies.

4. **Build and Run:**
```bash
Once Gradle sync is complete, you can build and run the project using the built-in emulator or a physical device.

Usage

    Run the Application:
        Connect an Android device or use an emulator.
        Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio to build and deploy the application.

    Explore the Modal Implementation:
        Navigate to app/src/main/java/com/example/yourapp/ui to find the modal implementation.
        Open MainActivity.java (or MainActivity.kt if using Kotlin) to see how the modal is instantiated and displayed.

    Customize the Modal:
        Modify the modal's appearance and behavior by editing the layout files located in res/layout/ and adjusting the code in the DialogFragment or AlertDialog implementation.

    Example Usage:

        To display the modal, you can use the following code snippet in your activity or fragment:

        java

        // Example for AlertDialog
        new AlertDialog.Builder(this)
            .setTitle("Modal Title")
            .setMessage("This is a modal message.")
            .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                    // Handle OK button press
                }
            })
            .setNegativeButton(android.R.string.cancel, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
                public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                    // Handle Cancel button press
                }
            })
            .setIcon(android.R.drawable.ic_dialog_alert)
            .show();
